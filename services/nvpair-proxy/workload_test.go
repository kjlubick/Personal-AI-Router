// TestHandleHTTP_WorkloadVisibleBeforeFirstByte is a regression test: a job
// must be on the wire as soon as it is admitted, not when the upstream first
// responds. An engine serializes inference on a single GPU slot, so a burst of
// parallel submissions is dispatched concurrently but streams back one at a
// time; emitting only at first byte made the waiting submissions invisible and
// they appeared one card at a time. Here the upstream accepts the connection
// but never sends a byte until released, so a first-byte emission could not
// have fired — yet the job must already be visible.
//
// The event is workload:submitted, carrying state "queued". "running" is
// reserved for the commit point, when the engine is actually producing content:
// a job waiting its turn inside the engine is not running, and the broker's
// store rejects a backwards transition, so a job that claimed "running" at
// dispatch time could never return to "queued" for a retry.
//
// proxy/request-started also stays at the commit point, so it names the node
// that actually served after any failover.
