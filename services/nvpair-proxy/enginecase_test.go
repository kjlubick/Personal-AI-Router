// The two proxies previously had parallel suites that drifted: same-named
// tests with different bodies, and behaviors covered on one side only. A
// single table means a case is either declared to apply to both engines or
// explicitly scoped to one, so a gap has to be a decision rather than an
// oversight.
//
// engineCase carries the fixtures a body cannot derive from the profile — the
// paths a client of that engine actually calls, and the shapes its upstream
// returns.
