// A detect path is a claim about what the install produces, and nothing checks
// it at install time: the runner extracts, looks for the declared path, finds
// nothing, and reports "was not detected after install" with no way to say
// why. That is what llama.cpp did on macOS and Linux, where the manifest named
// the layout of a local cmake build (build/bin/llama-server) rather than of the
// published release archive.
//
// Whether a path matches the archive is only knowable from the archive, so the
// real check is TestBundledInstallLayout, which downloads each one. What is
// checkable here is that the two paths agree: detecting one file and launching
// another lets an engine report installed and then fail to start.
//
// There is deliberately no rule about how deep a detect path may be. Archive
// shapes are the vendor's choice and they differ — llama.cpp wraps everything
// in a build-tagged directory the install has to strip, while Ollama's Linux
// archive is already bin/ and lib/ and must not be stripped. A convention
// asserted here would only encode one vendor's habit as if it were a contract.

// TestBundledInstallLayout downloads every archive the bundled manifests
// install from, extracts it the way the manifest says to, and checks the detect

// detect path no release archive could satisfy.
//
// Gated on an environment variable rather than a build tag: the archives run to
// gigabytes, but the `live` tag does not currently compile in this package, and
// a verification nobody can run is not one.
//
// Extraction runs through the host's tar, which libarchive-backed tar handles
// for .tar.gz, .tar.zst and .zip alike, so one host can verify another
// platform's archive. The --strip-components the manifest declares is applied,
// because that flag is what decides whether the detect path resolves. A
// platform whose install is not a tar invocation (Windows llama.cpp uses
// Expand-Archive) is still covered: only the extraction mechanism differs, and
// the archive it reads is the one fetched here.
